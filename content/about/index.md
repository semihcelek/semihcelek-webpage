Hi, I am Semih, I am interested in software development, especially in frontend development.
I have been developing frontend applications for about 7 months and I am planning to work on big projects to improve both my social and coding skills.

I am studying Computer Education at Bogazici University and living on Istanbul but due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, I'd returned my hometown Bursa. While I was on campus, I was dancing  Latin-American and attending dancing events. For upcoming terms, I am planning to join Radio Club and attending musical concerts.
