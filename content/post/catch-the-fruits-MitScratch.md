### Making Educational Game On Scratch

Making games for students have never been easier!. Scratch is an interactive web application, lets users to build games/programs with code blocks.

I have made an simple educational fruit catch game. In the game we are helping the litte monkey to catch some fruits. It helps children to learn fruits and have fun. The monkey is conrolled with left and right arrow keys and player should navigate to fruits to collect points.
