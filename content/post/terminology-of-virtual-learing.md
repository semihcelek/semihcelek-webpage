### New Form of Learning 

Technology is an indispensable part of our lives and education is becoming part of it. Technological advancements are changing the conventional way of teaching and it is useful to recognize these changes. I will briefly summarize 8 concepts of virtual learning that are mentioned on Anohina's paper. [^1]

On the paper, there are 8 aspects of virtual learning that are widely used and accepted, these categories are Computer (C), Electronic (E), Technology (T), Internet (I), Online (O), Web (W),
Distance (D), and Resource (R).

Computer (C) itself plays a huge role on virtual learning. Computer-based learning makes it possible to experience new ways of learning by using offline learning materials and applications. On the other hand Electronics(E) and electronic devices such as phones, tablets, tv's both online and offline helps learner to increase their productivity.

Also Internet(I) connection makes possible to connect computers to exchange information and data. Internet-based learning enables students to transfer data via TCP/IP protocol, and in some cases it uses socket connection to allow live data exchange, for example applications like Zoom, Skype, and Whatsapp uses this technology to enable live data flow.

Advancements in internet technology also makes Web(W) applications to empower learning experience by using browser-based JavaScript applications. Web-based HTML pages also helps students to share their static(image-video-written) content to the world.

All of this virtual-learning technologies help people to share Resource(R) and makes education to available all over the world.
Distance(D) education is also achievable thanks to virtual-learning technologies.

Finaly, use of Technology(T) and Online (O) learning methods makes it possible to both educator and student to experinence new kinds of learning material.
