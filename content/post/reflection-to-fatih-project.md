FATIH Project created an alternative platform in Turkish education system, it's aim is to increase productivity in education, and make education avaible on all over the country. Fatih Project constructed with two compotents, first one is hardware and software, second one is educational content.

To begin with, Fatih Project has improved Turkish education system drastically. Providing electronic devices helped students to reach educational contents on Eba and other sources. This helps students to expose educational contents outside the school. Also computer boards in the schools improves the quality of lectures. 

On the other hand, Fatih project encouraged students to use technology on their both daily and academic lifes. In general I realy like and support Fatih Project, it makes school more interactive and beneficial for both teacher and student. Also Eba education portal made Fatih project much more content-rich.
